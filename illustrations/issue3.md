# Feedback for Illustrations

I hired an illustrator on UpWork
to design these illustrations
that better explain the value proposition for GreenDeploy.io

## Analogy

Like how a web framework like Django, or Rails
tie together several open source libraries like postgres, python/ruby
in a single framework

GreenDeploy.io aims to do the same but for commonly used services such as GitHub, etc

| GreenDeploy.io is like a meta framework | Just like Django, Rails are web frameworks |
